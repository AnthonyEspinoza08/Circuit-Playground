#Python Lists - Introduction 
#Lists are comma delimited groups of variables

#Challenge #1
#Run the code, make sure you understand how the list is constructed
      
#- Can you explain the difference between a single object 
 # variable and a list?
#- Can you explain how lists are comma delimited sets of objects?
      
x = 9
#x is a single variable object
#9
#<class 'int'>

x =  [1, 2, 5, 66, 42, 19] #x is now a list of objects
#[1, 2, 5, 66, 42, 19]
#<class 'list'>

x =  ['fName', 'lName', 25, True, 4.2] #x is now a list of mixed objects
#['fName', 'lName', 25, True, 4.2]
#<class 'list'>
