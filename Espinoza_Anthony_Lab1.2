#Python Lists - Introduction 
#Lists are comma delimited groups of variables

#Challenge #1
#Run the code, make sure you understand how the list is constructed
      
#- Can you explain the difference between a single object 
 # variable and a list?
#- Can you explain how lists are comma delimited sets of objects?
      
x = 9
int_list = [3, 7, 12, 45, 88]
#x is a single variable object
#9
#<class 'int'>

x =  [1, 2, 5, 66, 42, 19] #x is now a list of objects
string_list = ["Purdy", "McCaffrey", "Kittle", "Williams"]
#[1, 2, 5, 66, 42, 19]
#<class 'list'>

x =  ['Anthony', '49ers', 25, True, 4.2]
mixed_list = [10, 3.14, "49ers", 42, 2.5, "Panthers"]
print(x[1])
print(int_list)
print(string_list)
print(mixed_list)
print(int_list[3])
print(string_list[1])
print(mixed_list[5])

#x is now a list of mixed objects
#['fName', 'lName', 25, True, 4.2]
#<class 'list'>
